## iOS Principles

Controller controls how view is presented
View has generic UI components
Model is view-independent

C talks to M and V, but M and V can't talk directly back
- M and V *never* talk to each other

View _can_ talk to C, but in blind & structured ways
- e.g. C creates target and hands view an arrow for its target
- V can _delegate_ e.g. `didScroll` to C

C has "data source" that V can access
Controller tunes into Model notifications (like tuning into a radio station)

MVC can have more MVCs inside them
- e.g. a tab bar is an MVC with additional MVC for each tab

## Objective-C

property = getter/setter for ivar
- `setMyValue`/`myValue` (not `getMyValue`)

Every class has a header (`.h`) and implementation (`.m`)
- header has public API
- implementation has private API and implementation
- `@end` at end of both files

header must have superclass
- like `@interface MyClass : NSObject`

### .m

    @interface Card()
      // private methods
    @end

### Objective C properties

    // With @property in .h, DON'T need to write any code in .m to make this
    // work! Don't even need `@synthesize`.
    @property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *contents
    @property (nonatomic, getter=isChosen) BOOL chosen;

weak pointer means keep it in memory as long as someone *else* has a strong
pointer to it, then set this pointer to null (0)
- strong/weak not required for basic types like BOOL
- `retain` is pretty much the same as `strong`

nonatomic means the property is not threadsafe
- means can't have 2 threads access this property at the same time
- if we don't say nonatomic, XCode adds locking to its autogenerated code - not
  simple! We don't want to deal with that yet.
- most types will say nonatomic


      // This is a method definition.
      // The method is named `contents` and returns a pointer to an NSString.
      - (NSString *)contents

`@synthesize contents=_contents` means "Hey xcode, name the ivar for the
`contents` property to `_contents`"

in obj-c, you can send messages to null pointers and it won't crash
- will return 0

classes are always pointed to in Obj-C
- can't have `GBWCard`, must have `* GBWCard`

## Method calls

Dot notation: `card.contents`
- ONLY used for properties (`card.contents`, `card.contents =`)
Square brackets: `[something isEqualToString:other]`

`self` is the reference to this object

Use `isEqualToString` because `==` would compare the pointers
